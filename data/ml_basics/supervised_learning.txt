##SUPERVISED LEARNING

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data.
Each training example comes with an input vector and a corresponding target output.
The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs that generalizes well to unseen data.

Common supervised learning tasks include classification and regression.

Examples of supervised algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- Gradient Boosting Methods

Key aspects of supervised learning:
- There is a clear notion of "right" and "wrong" via labels.
- The model can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification,
  and mean squared error or mean absolute error for regression.
- It assumes that training and test data are drawn from the same distribution.

Supervised learning is widely used in applications such as spam detection, credit scoring, image classification,
and demand forecasting.
