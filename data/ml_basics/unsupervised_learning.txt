##UNSUPERVISED LEARNING

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data.
The data does not come with explicit target values. Instead, the goal is to discover hidden patterns,
structure, or relationships in the data.

Common unsupervised learning tasks include:
- Clustering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Density Estimation
- Anomaly or Outlier Detection

Examples of unsupervised algorithms:
- k-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- DBSCAN
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- t-SNE and UMAP for visualization

Key characteristics of unsupervised learning:
- There is no explicit right or wrong label, making evaluation more challenging.
- It is useful for exploratory data analysis and finding natural groupings in data.
- It can help pre-process data for downstream tasks, e.g., using PCA to reduce dimensionality
  before applying a supervised algorithm.

Example use cases:
- Customer segmentation in marketing
- Grouping news articles by topic
- Detecting unusual system behavior for security monitoring
